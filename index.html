        <h2 class="nobreak">THE THREE DIAMONDS.</h2>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>“Do you remember the diamonds we found
        up at old Gray Jake Wagner’s house when we
        were making that little raid around Taylorsville?”
        was asked of Colonel Andrew M. Benson, of
        Portland, Me., by a former companion with
        whom he was dining at Syracuse, N. Y. The
        colonel at first failed to recall the circumstances,
        but on the mention of a certain Miss Wagner’s
        name a relaxation of his features showed that all
        recollection of the episode was not lost, and the
        dinner party was soon in possession of the facts,
        as follows: In the latter part of the year 1864,
        Colonel Benson, the captain of the First District
        of Columbia cavalry, with Colonel James M. Gere,
        also captain at the time, Colonel Walpole, of
        Syracuse, and Lieutenant Cornell, of Vermont,
        were confined in the prison pen at Columbia,
        S. C., and during December they escaped and
        made their way to Crab Orchard, on Doe River
        Cove. There they found a company of 83 struggling<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
        Federal soldiers. Though in the heart of the
        enemy’s country, the members of this little band
        were suddenly stimulated to excessive bravery
        by thus meeting with their fellows, and conceived
        it would be a fine joke to make a little raid on
        Taylorsville, a village nearly 50 miles further
        north. The daring of the scheme appeared when,
        upon examination, it was found that 30 of the
        men had just one round of ammunition, while 31
        had only one extra charge. Six, however, were
        mounted, and, at the head of this plucky detachment
        of cavalry Captain Benson was placed. Captain
        Gere led the infantry, and the whole squad
        was in command of Lieutenant James Hartley.
        Such was the make-up of the band that started
        out with more pluck than powder to capture
        Taylorsville. About 40 miles of the distance had
        been covered when the plantation of a rebel was
        reached who was notorious in all the country
        round. A halt was ordered to treat with the
        owner, Gray Jake Wagner, who was at that time
        just walking out to feed his hogs.</p>
        
        <p>“Oh, take what you want; but only spare my
        life,” cried Gray Jake Wagner, throwing up his
        hands like a flash and dropping his pail of swill
        as a bullet whistled past his ear, advising him of
        his distinguished visitors.</p>
        
        <p>“We want,” said Captain Benson, “whatever<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
        you have of use to us.” And it took but a glance
        to tell the astonished planter that nothing could
        come amiss to that ragged company so lately escaped
        from the horrors of a rebel prison. Now,
        among other members of the Wagner family
        was a pretty daughter of the old rebel, aged
        eighteen, who had just returned from boarding
        school to spend the holidays. After listening to
        the conversation with her father, and catching a
        glimpse of the visitors, she ran frightened to
        her own room. The troops swarmed about the
        place like bees and rushed into the house at
        every door. Several soldiers soon found their
        way even to the room of the scared young lady
        and demanded the immediate surrender of her
        revolver and ammunition.</p>
        
        <p>“I have no revolver,” cried the frightened girl.</p>
        
        <p>“You have,” yelled one of the soldiers with an
        oath, “and you will give it up.” But at just this
        juncture the tall form of Captain Benson, who was
        then a dashing officer of 28, appeared, and he
        took in the situation at a glance. Drawing his
        revolver, he threatened to drop the first man
        who touched a thing in that room or failed to
        leave without a word. The men withdrew in
        silence, while the frightened Miss Wagner, with
        tears and sobs, expressed her heartfelt thanks to
        her gallant protector.</p>
        
        <p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>
        
        <p>“What did you find in the house?” asked Captain
        Benson of the infantry officer, as they left
        the place. “I found these diamonds,” he quietly
        added, pointing to three glistening drops on his
        shoulder. The raid did not extend very far beyond
        Gray Jake Wagner’s. Taylorsville, they learned,
        was full of rebel soldiers, and the little party
        barely managed to reach the Union lines.</p>
        
        <p>Miss Wagner obtained in some way the address
        of her benefactor, and afterward, by letter, it is
        said, she sent her thanks, which she could only
        partially express in the excitement of their meeting.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">BUILDING A BRIDGE IN SEVENTEEN HOURS.</h2>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>In July, 1861, General J. D. Cox’s division was
        chasing General Henry A. Wise’s Confederate
        forces up the Kanawha River, in West Virginia,
        and to impede the rapid advance of the Union
        troops the bridge across Pocotaligo Creek was
        destroyed. The stream was only a couple of rods
        wide, but its banks were steep and the bed of the
        creek was too much of a slough to allow fording
        by the wagon trains and artillery. The regular
        army engineers wanted a few weeks’ time to
        prepare plans, and considered it necessary to send
        to Cincinnati for tools and material to construct a
        bridge. The General, being informed that the<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
        Eleventh Ohio Infantry Regiment, then encamped
        at “Poco,” had a company composed entirely
        of mechanics, sent for the captain, and,
        after a short conference with that officer, directed
        him to put his men at work. Commencing at
        nine o’clock in the morning, in seventeen hours
        a substantial “bridge” was built across the creek,
        and which was used by army wagons, cannons
        and soldiers for a long time, probably until the
        war closed. A raft of logs, timbers from a deserted
        house, and poles cut in the woods near by,
        were the materials used for the bridge, the tools
        being a few axes and augers. These practical
        bridge-builders were members of Company K,
        principally machinists, molders, etc., from the
        shops of Lane &amp; Bodley, of Cincinnati, the captain
        being their late employer, P. P. Lane, afterward
        colonel of the regiment.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">THE COLONEL’S FORAGED BREAKFAST.</h2>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>Colonel Johnson, commanding the 108th Regiment,
        Illinois Volunteer Infantry, during the late
        war, up to the time he fairly earned and secured
        his “single star,” was a strict disciplinarian.
        Straggling and foraging were especially tabooed
        by him; certain and severe was the punishment
        of the culprit who was caught away from his command
        without authority, and if any foraged provisions<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
        were found on the scoundrel they were at
        once confiscated. As it was not practicable to return
        the provisions to the lawful owner, the
        colonel would have them served up at his own
        mess table, “to keep them from going to waste.”</p>
        
        <p>As a consequence, the colonel was cordially
        hated by many of his men, and many were the
        plans laid down by them “to get even” and circumvent
        him, but, owing to his astuteness, they
        generally came to grief.</p>
        
        <p>One day a soldier of the regiment, who had the
        reputation of being “a first-class, single-handed
        forager,” but who had nevertheless been repeatedly
        compelled to disgorge his irregularly procured
        supply of fresh meat, and as repeatedly to
        pass an interval of his valuable time in the regimental
        bull-pen, slipped away from camp and,
        after an absence of several hours, returned with a
        loaded haversack and tried to get to his tent
        without attracting any attention. He was noticed,
        however, and promptly arrested and escorted to
        regimental headquarters.</p>
        
        <p>“Omar, you infernal scoundrel, you have been
        foraging again,” said the colonel.</p>
        
        <p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>
        
        <p>“Haven’t, eh! Let’s see what is in your haversack.
        Leg o’ mutton, eh! Killed some person’s
        sheep,” said the colonel. Omar was sent to the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
        guard house as usual, and the foraged property
        to the colonel’s cook.</p>
        
        <p>The regimental mess, consisting of most of the
        field and staff officers, had fresh meat for supper
        and breakfast. During the latter meal the colonel
        happened to look out from under the tent fly
        that was in use as a mess-room, and noticed
        Omar, who was under guard cleaning up around
        headquarters, eyeing him very closely. The colonel
        remarked: “Well, prisoner, what is it?”</p>
        
        <p>“Nothing, colonel,” replied Omar, “except I was
        just wondering how you liked your breakfast of
        <em>fried dog</em>.”</p>
        
        <p>Consternation seized the party at the table.
        With an exclamation or expletive, every one of
        them sprang to his feet, and from under the tent
        fled.</p>
        
        <p>Omar ran for his life, and at once, as per preconcerted
        agreement, over half the men in the
        regiment commenced barking and howling like
        dogs—big dogs, little dogs, hoarse and fine, bass
        and soprano, fortissimo and mezzo-soprano, dogs
        ’round the corner and dogs under the house—in
        short, there was the “dog”-onedest kind of a
        racket made until the colonel grasped his sword,
        and, foaming with rage, rushed for the men’s
        tents; but they were too old to be caught.</p>
        
        <p>For a long time, though, they would “regulate”<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
        the colonel if he showed signs of being excessive
        by barking, but at their peril, for he would certainly
        have killed a <em>barker</em> if discovered.</p>
        
        <p>After that breakfast the regimental mess strictly
        abstained from eating any second-hand foraged
        meat.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">THE NOBLE ACT OF A HERO.</h2>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>Louis Abear, says the Detroit <cite>Free Press</cite>, was a
        private in Company H, Fifth Michigan Cavalry,
        and made a good soldier. At the battle of Trevillian
        Station he was taken prisoner, and before
        his release he was confined in five different prison-pens
        and two jails.</p>
        
        <p>While he was in Millen Prison, an exchange of
        sixty prisoners was to be made. The officer of the
        day told off sixty names at the door of the pen,
        but for some reason, probably because he was too
        ill, or perhaps dead, one man did not come forth.
        At that moment Louis, who had been sent out
        after fuel, under guard of course, came through
        the gates pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with
        wood.</p>
        
        <p>“Here, Louis, here’s a chance for you. We want
        sixty men to go North and are short one. Jump
        into the ranks here!” exclaimed the officer.</p>
        
        <p>“To be exchanged?” asked Louis, trembling
        more than he did when under fire.</p>
        
        <p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>
        
        <p>“Yes. Be quick.”</p>
        
        <p>“Then take Hank. He’s sick, and will die if he
        remains here,” and Louis darted into the hospital
        ward. Hank had a pair of pantaloons and shoes,
        but no coat or hat. Louis pulled off his, put them
        on Hank, and brought him out, weak and tottering.
        As Hank filed out the gate and once more
        breathed the air of freedom, Louis, hatless and
        coatless, took hold of the handles of his wheelbarrow
        and started for another load of wood.</p>
        
        <p>Can mortal mind conceive of such an act? It
        cost him seven months of a living death, and all for
        a man with whom he was not even intimately acquainted.</p>
        
        <p>And now for the other side of the picture. Ever
        since the close of the war, until a few months
        ago, when Hank died, these two men have lived
        right here in Wayne County, Hank with a home
        and family, Louis with neither; have met occasionally,
        but at no time did Hank ever refer to the
        act in Millen Prison that set him free and saved
        his life; never invited him to his home; never alluded
        to the past, or addressed his savior other
        than as a mere acquaintance. On his death-bed,
        however, he told the story, and asked his relatives
        if they ever had an opportunity, to befriend Louis
        for his sake. It was tardy acknowledgement of
        one of the noblest acts the world has ever known.</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">SOME OF LINCOLN’S JOKES.</h2>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>President Lincoln has been made responsible
        for so many jokes, writes Ben. Perley Poore, that
        he reminds one of a noted Irish wit who, having
        been ruined by indorsing the notes of his friends,
        used to curse the day when he learned to write
        his name, as he had obtained such a reputation
        for willingness to oblige that he could not refuse.
        Mr. Lincoln might well have regretted ever having
        made a joke, for he was expected to say something
        funny on all occasions, and has been made answerable
        for all manner of jests, stories and repartee,
        as if he had combined all the elements of humor,
        commonplace heartlessness and coarseness,
        mingled with a passion for reviving the jokes of
        Joe Miller and the circus clowns. Yet he did say
        many excellent things. On one occasion Senator
        Wade came to him and said:</p>
        
        <p>“I tell you, Mr. President, that unless a proposition
        for emancipation is adopted by the government,
        we will all go to the devil. At this very
        moment we are not over one mile from hell.”</p>
        
        <p>“Perhaps not,” said Mr. Lincoln, “as I believe
        that is just about the distance from here to the
        Capitol, where you gentlemen are in session.”</p>
        
        <p>On one occasion, at a reception, when the crowd
        of citizens and soldiers were surging through the<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
        salons of the White House, evidently controlled by
        the somewhat brusque Western element, a gentleman
        said to him:</p>
        
        <p>“Mr. President, you must diminish the number
        of your friends, or Congress must enlarge this
        edifice.”</p>
        
        <p>“Well,” promptly replied Mr. Lincoln, “I have
        no idea of diminishing the number of my friends;
        but the only question with me now is whether it
        will be best to have the building stretched or split.”</p>
        
        <p>At one of these receptions, when a paymaster in
        full major’s uniform was introduced, he said:</p>
        
        <p>“Being here, Mr. Lincoln, I thought I would call
        and pay my respects.”</p>
        
        <p>“From the complaints made by the soldiers,”
        responded the President, “I guess that is all any
        of you do pay.”</p>
        
        <p><a id="Ref_12" href="#BRef_12">Ward Lamon, when Lincoln had appointed him</a>
        Marshal of the District of Columbia, accidentally
        found himself in a street fight, and, in restoring
        peace, he struck one of the belligerents with his
        fist, a weapon with which he was notoriously
        familiar. The blow was a harder one than Lamon
        intended, for the fellow was knocked senseless,
        taken up unconscious, and lay for some hours on
        the border of life and death. Lamon was alarmed,
        and the next morning reported the affair to the
        President.</p>
        
        <p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>
        
        <p>On another occasion a young soldier had fallen
        out of ranks when his regiment passed through
        Washington, and, getting drunk, failed to join
        his regiment when it left the city. To the friend
        who came to secure a pardon, Mr. Lincoln said:
        “Well, I think the boy can do us more good above
        ground than under ground,” and he wrote out the
        pardon.</p>
        
        <p>In all such cases as the above, where the ordinary
        human weakness was the motive, Mr. Lincoln’s
        heart was tender as a woman’s, but to prove
        that he could entertain no sympathy for a cool,
        deliberate, mercenary crime, he was approached
        by the Hon. John B. Alley, of Massachusetts, one
        day, with a petition for the pardon of a man who
        had been convicted of engaging in the slave trade,
        and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and
        the payment of a fine of one thousand dollars.
        His term of imprisonment had expired, but in
        default of payment of the fine, he was still held.
        In answer to the appeal for pardon Mr. Lincoln
        said: “You know my weakness is to be, if possible,
        too easily moved by appeals for mercy, and if
        this man were guilty of the foulest murder that
        the arm of man could perpetrate, I might forgive
        him on such an appeal; but the man who
        would go to Africa and rob her of her children
        and sell them into an interminable bondage with<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
        no other motive than that which is furnished by
        dollars and cents, is so much worse than the most
        depraved murderer that he can never receive pardon
        at my hands. No, he may rot in jail before
        he shall have liberty by any act of mine.”</p>
        
        <p>Upon another occasion the wife of a rebel officer,
        held as a prisoner of war, begged for the relief
        of her husband, and to strengthen her appeal
        said that he was a very religious man. In granting
        the release of her husband, Mr. Lincoln said:
        “Tell your husband when you meet him that I am
        not much of a judge of religion, but that in my
        opinion the religion that sets men to rebel and
        fight against their government because they think
        that government does not sufficiently help some
        men to eat their bread in the sweat of other men’s
        faces, is not the sort of religion upon which men
        can get to heaven.”</p>
        
        <p>One day news of a great battle in progress
        reached Mr. Lincoln, and his anxiety was so great
        that he could eat nothing. Soon after he was seen
        to take a Bible and retire to his room, and in a few
        minutes he was overheard in one of the most
        earnest prayers for the success of our arms. Later
        in the day a Union victory was announced, and
        Mr. Lincoln, with a beaming face, exclaimed:
        “Good news! good news! The victory is ours, and
        God is good.”</p>

        <h2 class="nobreak">AN ARMY NEWSBOY’S ROMANCE.</h2>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>So many acts of heartlessness and cruelty during
        the great civil war have been recorded that it
        is a real pleasure to have an opportunity to
        record an act of manly kindness on the part of
        a gallant Confederate soldier to a Yankee boy.
        In the town of Bennington, in the Green Mountains
        of Vermont, in the spring of 1861, there lived
        a poor woman with six children, five boys and
        one little girl, the youngest of the former a stripling
        14 years old. When the wires flashed the
        news from Washington all over our land that
        the rebels had fired upon the old flag at Fort
        Sumpter, the four older boys responded to the
        country’s call and hurried to the seat of war.
        The younger lad, his heart fired with genuine
        Green Mountain patriotism, ran away from home
        and, eluding pursuit, made his way to the camp
        on the Potomac. But his ardor was somewhat
        dampened by the discovery of the fact that he
        could not, in consequence of his youth and diminutiveness,
        enlist as a soldier. Determined to remain
        at the front; and having, as the saying is,
        to scratch for a living, he went to selling newspapers
        to the soldiers. Leaving the camp between
        New Baltimore and Warrenton about the
        10th of November, 1862, he went to Washington
        for a supply of papers. Having accomplished his
        object, the young lad set out on horseback for
        the camp, having to travel a distance of thirty<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
        miles. A change of position by the army during
        his absence had occurred, and as a consequence he
        ran into the rebel picket line and was taken to
        General J. E. B. Stuart’s headquarters, at a hotel
        in Warrenton, and from there sent to Libby
        Prison, in Richmond, arriving there November 13.
        Major Turner was in command of the prison, and
        when the young prisoner was brought into his
        presence, observing that he was a mere boy, the
        Major spoke kindly to him, and, after his name
        had been enrolled, asked him the customary question,
        if he had any money or valuables about his
        person. The frightened boy had managed to
        conceal his money, $380, in his boots, and in answer
        to the question, put his hand down, and
        while a tear-drop glistened in his bright eye and
        his boyish lip quivered, he brought it forth and
        handed it to the rebel major, and trying hard
        to choke down the swelling in his throat, he told
        of his widowed mother at home, his four brothers
        in the army, his having made his money selling
        papers, and saving it to send with his brothers’
        wages to his mother. The Major folded the boy’s
        passes around the money and said to him: “You
        shall have this again, my boy, when you are permitted
        to go from here.” Six weeks afterward
        the lad was paroled, and, repairing to Major
        Turner’s office, the kind officer, handing him
        the package of money and the passes, just as he
        received them, said: “Here is your money, my
        boy.” With trembling hands, but a joyous heart,
        the little fellow took the package. He was sent
        to Washington, and a few weeks afterward was
        going his old rounds selling newspapers. The
        boy was Doc Aubrey, the newsboy of the Iron
        Brigade, who now resides in Milwaukee.</p>

        contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
        or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
        intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
        other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
        cannot be read by your equipment.

        defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
        receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
        written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

        1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

        violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
        agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
        limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
        unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
        remaining provisions.

        <h4>
        Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
        electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
        computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
        exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
        from people in all walks of life.
    </h4>
        
        <h4>
        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
        assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
        goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
        remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
        and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
        generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
        Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
        Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

    </h2>
        
        <h4>
        Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
        public support and donations to carry out its mission of
        increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
        freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
        array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
        ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
        status with the IRS.
    </h4>
        
        <h4>
        The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
        charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
        States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
        considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
        with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
        where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
        DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
        visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
    </h4>
        
       <h4>
        While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
        have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
        against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
        approach us with offers to donate.

     <h4>
        International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
        any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
        outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

        Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
        methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
        ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

        </h2>
        
        <h4>
        Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
        Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
        freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
        distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
        volunteer support.
        </h4>
        
        <h4>
        Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
        editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
        the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
        necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
        edition.
